## Fish Ecology, Evolution, and Exploitation
### Chapter 3
# Individual Growth and Reproduction

Energy budget theory.

VBGF (1957)

Lester is good.
Quince is little difficult because it does not go with the actual measurement value

growth model based on BHLHI

### The aims of this Chapter
- To develop description of grwoth and Reproduction of individuals.
- To establish the asymptotic size as a master trait
- to determine the parameters in the energy budget in terms of individual size, the asymptotic size, and a set of life-history parameters

## 3-1 VBGF
- Biphasic. Popular
  - Growth of juvenile - adult treated separately. Good. Acute change?
- VBGF following Putter equation
  - exponent 3/4 rather than 2/3
- VBGF's L_inf and K are correlated. Therefore, one can cover one's mess. Uncertainty in estiamtes, SD is enormous.

## 3-2 Asymptotic size as a master trait
- Asymptotic size owing to the fdifference between catabolism and anabolism
   - Is it realistic? Often overestimating or underestimating.
   - Determinate growth only
- Relative maturation sieze, should not be treated as a mean.
  - Relative maturation size may varie depends on the life history. Like fast slow, how determinate or indeterminate.
- Biphasic model can describe reproductive investment.
  - monophasic can too
- Reproductive efficiency as 0.22 that also includes energetic investment for reproductive behaviror.
