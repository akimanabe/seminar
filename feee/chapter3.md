## Fish Ecology, Evolution, and Exploitation
### Chapter 3
# Individual Growth and Reproduction

Energy budget theory.

VBGF (1957)

Lester is good.
Quince is little difficult because it does not go with the actual measurement value

growth model based on BHLHI

### The aims of this Chapter
- To develop description of grwoth and Reproduction of individuals.
- To establish the asymptotic size as a master trait
- to determine the parameters in the energy budget in terms of individual size, the asymptotic size, and a set of life-history parameters

## 3-1 VBGF
- Biphasic. Popular
  - Growth of juvenile - adult treated separately. Good. Acute change?
- VBGF following Putter equation
  - exponent 3/4 rather than 2/3
- VBGF's L_inf and K are correlated. Therefore, one can cover one's mess. Uncertainty in estiamtes, SD is enormous.

## 3-2 Asymptotic size as a master trait
- Asymptotic size owing to the fdifference between catabolism and anabolism
   - Is it realistic? Often overestimating or underestimating.
   - Determinate growth only
- Relative maturation sieze, should not be treated as a mean.
  - Relative maturation size may varie depends on the life history. Like fast slow, how determinate or indeterminate.
- Biphasic model can describe reproductive investment.
  - monophasic can too
- Reproductive efficiency as 0.22 that also includes energetic investment for reproductive behaviror.

## 3-3

## 3-4
- LHparam correlate with asymptotic siez
  - Growth coeff, tmat, sizemat, reprodinv, and longevity
- **really? Consider determinate and indeterminate**
- "This implies that knowing only asymptotic size W_inf and ghte growth rate coefficient A, all other parameters can be estimated"
- Three aspects of an answer to the invariant varying thru the species.
   - semantic
   - empiric
   - theoretic
- LHI is not a statement that LH do not vary between species. but rather that the variation is random and unexplained, at least according to our current level of understanding.
- Defense
  - Fish with defense, investment, cryptic, hiding, causing the lH to vary.

## 3-5
 - BHLHI may seems a good idea.
 - slow-fast continuum, determinate-indeterminate continuum is not solved yet.
 - Sacrifice existent, but overall description seems okay
